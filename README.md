Code as I followed along with [Your First Meteor Application](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA8KVAY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MA8KVAY&linkCode=as2&tag=wiga-20&linkId=J3YJOELQPY526B3D).

Made slight mods here and there.

The book is a great little intro to Meteor.js, learned most of the features I need to get off the ground with the f/w. Thanks a lot, [David Turnbull](http://davidturnbull.com).

[The demo](http://leaderboard-adityamenon.meteor.com) is up on the meteorjs servers.
